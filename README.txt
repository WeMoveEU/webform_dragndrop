This module adds a drag and drop element to webform components. It's
essentially an extension of the default webform file component.

Requirements

jQuery_update
webform

Quick Start

1. Enable the module.
2. Add the 'Drag and drop upload element' component to any webform
3. Configure the element.

Note from a Developer

As IE doesn't support this method of dragging files into an input type file,
the element isn't displayed for these users, instead replaced with a default
file input.
